// -------------------------------------------------------
// Assignment 1. 
// Written by: Elias Al Homsi, id: 40027818
// For COMP 248 Section P (COMP-248-2162-P) â€“ Fall 2016
// Question 2.
// Date: 17 September 2016
// Purpose: A Game of guessing a random number.
// Input: Maximum of 5 tries. Integers guessing the number.
// Output: Indications (higher or lower) and results.
// --------------------------------------------------------


// We need this for generating the Random number
import java.util.Random;
// We need this for input
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * To whom it may concern:
 *
 * This source code is the solution of Question 2 of Assignment 1.
 *
 * Format:
 * --------
 * 1) All questions of the assignment are named Problem#. 2) # is the number of
 * the question. 3) Each problem has its own main method. 
 *
 * Steps (Algorithm):
 * ------------------
 * 1) We define all the variables we need. Including the random variable of
 * class Random.
 *
 * 2) We generate a random number using the nextInt method of the object random.
 *
 * 3) We may assume that the user will enter valid integers. So, we read user
 * input without processing.
 *
 * 4) We read the input of the first iteration of the loop and then we enter the main loop of the program.
 * We respond to user input by either too high or too low or found.
 *
 * 5) Output the result and end of the program.
 *
 * Variables: ("The naming convention is already clear, but just in case")
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * *Scanner input: is a Scanner object that we are going to use for input
 * 
 * *Random random: is a psuedo-random generator. We use it with the method nextInt()
 * 
 * *int numberToGuess: the user has to guess this number.
 * 
 * *boolean found: a variable used to check if the user was successful.
 * 
 * *int guessCount: an integer which is the counter of guesses the user used so far.
 * 
 * *String answer: is a String object that holds the answer of either too high or too low.
