// For COMP 248 Section P (COMP-248-2162-P) â€“ Fall 2016
// Question 3
// Date: 30 September 2016
// Purpose: Implementation of the DrawAnElephant Game
// Input: There is no interaction required from the user.
// Output: The status after each player rolls and at the end the result of the game.
// --------------------------------------------------------
// We need this for input

/**
 * To whom it may concern:
 *
 * This source code is the solution of Question 3 of Assignment 2.
 *
 * Format: 
 * -------- 
 * 1) All questions of the assignment are named Problem#. 
 * 2) # is the number of the question. 
 * 3) Each problem has its own main method.
 *
 * Steps (Algorithm): 
 * ------------------ 
 * 1) First we define the variables we need
 *      a) we need to define boolean variables for each player
 *      b) the quantitiy left to draw and the ability to draw
 *      c) the boolean gameEnd which would be used for the while loop
 *      d) Player1Win boolean: if false it means that player 2 wins.
 *      e) round counter
 *      f) a function for rolling the dice.
 *
 * 2) we initialize the game by setting the body to drawable.
 * 
 * 3) we enter the while loop which has a switch statement for handling the cases.
 *      a) each switch statement would check if the element is drawable or not
 *      b) it would also check how many left to draw
 *      c) once able to draw it would check wether other elements just became drawable. (ears after head).
 *      d) if drawable we would decrement the number left to draw by 1.
 * 
 * 4) inside the while loop we print the status of each round.
 *      a) the roll of player1 and player2 and their body parts so far.
 * 
 * 5) we would check now to see if anyone has won. In that case the while loop would end. 
 *      a) we would save only one boolean variable in order to show if player1 or player2 has won.
 * 
 * 5) we print the result of the game
 *
 * Variables: ("The naming convention is already clear, but just in case")
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * *Scanner input: is a Scanner object that we are going to use for input
 *
 * *boolean player<#>CanDraw<BodyPart>: This general format which would require us to define 6 booleans
 *  for each player specify whether player # could draw <bodyPart> or not.
 *
 * *int player<#><BodyPart>Left: This genral format would require us to define 6 integers for each player.
 *      this would define how many of <BodyPart> the player <#> has to draw yet.
 *
 * *boolean gameEnd: The sentinel of the while loop. When it turns to true the while loop would end.
 * 
 * *int round: the round counter. It holds the number of the current round
 * 
 * *boolean player1Win: it determines the result of the game. In case of false, player2 wins. In case of 
 *      True Player1 wins.
 * 
 * *int player1Roll, player2Roll: Integers holding the rolling value (RollTheDice).
