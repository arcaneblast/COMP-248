/**
 * To whom it may concern:
 *
 * This source code is the solution of Question 3 of Assignment 3. This is only
 * the driver class of Scale.
 *
 * Format: 
 * -------- 
 * 1) All questions of the assignment are named Problem#. 
 * 2) #is the number of the question. 
 * 3) Each problem has its own main method.
